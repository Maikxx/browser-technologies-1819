# Browser technologies

[ðŸš€ Live demo ðŸš€](https://browser-technologies.herokuapp.com/)

This project makes use of dirty tricks to maximize browser support through progressive enhancement.
This project will work with either with or without JavaScript in a very similar fashion.
This app might or might not work below IE6, the DOM manipulation guides of these old browsers are so vague it gave me a headache.
Massive respect for the people that ruined their life trying to make something out of JavaScript in the pre-IE6 era.

### Installation

### Pre-install

* Make sure to install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).
* Make sure the **port** specified in the [index.ts](server/src/index.ts) is available (defaults to 3000).

### Install

* Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Maikxx/browser-technologies-1819.git`.
* Navigate into the directory: `cd browser-technologies-1819`.
* Install dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install`.
* Start the client with: `yarn start-client` or `npm run start-client`.
* Start the server with: `yarn start-server` or `npm run start-server`.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1.2

The link to the repository for this exercise can be found [here](https://github.com/Maikxx/project-1-1819).

#### Feature tests and solutions

##### Images

When disabling images in my OBA application, most of the page still stands.
Things that break are:

* The logo, which has an alt text, and is not a disaster to not be there.
* MapBox still works, but has some weird behaviour, which I couldn't find out, it sometimes works, and sometimes doens't.
* Images of content items are broken, which is clumsy, but still workable, since there is all the metadata below it, like the title and the authors. This behaviour can be seen below.

![Broken images](./docs/assets/broken-images.png)

A simple improvement that can be made here is to fix the `alt="undefined"` to be `alt`, which still keeps the alt tag, while not showing the ugly placeholder alt text.

![Enhanced images](./docs/assets/enhanced-images.png)

##### Custom fonts

This test is pretty easy, since there will not change anything to the interface when disabling custom fonts, since this application does not make use of custom fonts. If I were to be using custom fonts, I would have fallen back to another font because of this:  `font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;`.

##### JavaScript off

When disabling JavaScript, it is simple, just a white page is shown, since everything is rendered into the `main` element from JavaScript.
This can be solved (which I am not going to do right now, because that is an issue for the other course) is to render the application on the server and send it to the client. This would show a lot of the content just fine, with the exeption for the map on the homepage.

As far as page navigation goes, nothing will work either right now, since I am using buttons to push the history state, while if I were to use anchor tags, with server side rendering a lot more of the pages would work.

##### Color

On MacOS, you can invert the colors by pressing `CMD + Option + F5`.
My application works surpisingly well, seeing as I didn't spend any time in this mode while designing.
There only appears an issue when watching the floorplans, where the toilets and elevators are hard to see against the background.

I tried to make screenshots from this, however to my (dumb) surprise screenshots from this mode are not taken in the inverted mode. You will need to test it out yourself in the live version to view it.

##### Mouse / Trackpad

When not using the mouse, I cannot navigate to the next page each time, since the dots on the map are `div`s instead of `button`s.

This can be fixed on the first page, however the second page contains a more difficult task to improve this, since the `polygon` shapes have an event listener on them. If you know anything about HTML, you know that you can't **directly** append a `button` to an `svg` element.

You could solve this by doing something like this:

```html
<foreignObject>
    <html:button></html:button>
</foreignObject>
```

This however would require additional positioning, which I will not do right now, but it is possible.

The final page with all the suggestions works fine without a mouse or trackpad.

##### Broadband

When I first ran the audits test in Google Chrome on a 13inch MacBook from 2015, the results were pretty shocking, as can be seen below.

![Initial test results](./docs/assets/initial-test-results.png)

However, when looking into the issues that it gave me in the audits tab, I realized I was testing the local development version, which has no compression and minification.

The live test results (from [Netlify](https://minor-web-project-1.netlify.com/)) can be seen below.

![Live test results](./docs/assets/live-test-results.png)

The main issue that can be seen here is that the MapBox css stylesheet is blocking the render flow (0.15s), and that it takes about 3.2 seconds before the page displays meaningful content, due to the fact that everything is rendered with JavaScript, which first needs to be parsed and executed.

Modified this code `<link href="https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v0.52.0/mapbox-gl.css" rel="preconnect">` to have `rel="preconnect"` instead of `rel="stylesheet"`.

This however broke MapBox, because it couldn't recognize that it's required stylesheet was loaded in.

The only way to further improve the performance is to fetch all data on the server and just send the rendered page back to the user.

I have kept in mind the slow API of the OBA when fetching book suggestions with a loader though.

##### Cookies

I don't use cookies in this application, however, this application uses localStorage as can be seen in the section below, which causes a bit of trouble when turning off cookies (which is bound to localStorage, for some reason).

##### LocalStorage

When turning off the localStorage (by turning off cookies), the page loads as usual, it also navigates as usual to the second page, but when navigating to the third page everything breaks. This is caused by the fact that localStorage access is disallowed, where JavaScript is looking for it. Because there is a `try/catch` block surrounding the localStorage pieces, it enters the `catch` block. Ideally you would continue fetching data in the `catch` block, when the `localStorage` is not available.

#### Screen reader test

You can activate the MacOS screen reader with `CMD + Option + F5`.

Since refactoring the maps markers to be `button` elements instead of `div` elements, the screen reader is able to walk through this part of the application.

As could be seen in the screenshots above, the accesibility score is pretty high, due to semantic setup of the pages, with a few exceptions that are discussed above.

It appears to be pretty much not necessary to use ARIA attributes on most of the pages, with maybe the exception of the floorplan svg elements.

#### Device lab test

The device lab test for the OBA application was not very useful, since the app full on crashed on all the browsers on the devices. This might be due to the fact that I did not specify for these kind of browsers. Unfortunately the set up for the device lab took way more than the time it actually helped me. The reason that the browsers don't work is because I did write only ESNext code and did not compile it down to ES3, on which these browsers run.
